# African Marketplace

This directory is a web application called African Marketplace. The purpose is to create a platform where local sellers can market their products to customers. The application was created with React and Redux. The application is deployed using Vercel and can be viewed by clicking the link below.

## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, JWT-Authentication, Axios

The application was created with React and the API connects to the African Marketplace backend directory. We installed axios and used it to make CRUD requests. JWT-Authentication allowed us to authicate users and keep track of who was logged in. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Optimizations: 

We utilized react in order to make large, reusable components.
